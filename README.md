# Project Explanation

This project is focused on creating an application that helps Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) practitioners with game planning for each guard position. The goal is to provide users with insights on what actions to take in different situations and what outcomes might result from those actions.

BJJ is a dynamic and strategic martial art, and having a well-defined game plan for each guard position can significantly enhance a practitionerâ€™s performance. This project helps to map out the various guards, the appropriate techniques for each, and the possible transitions or counters that may arise based on the opponent's movements and decisions.

## Features

- **Guard Position**: A comprehensive list of BJJ guard positions.
- **Action Recommendations**: Suggested techniques (sweeps, submissions, etc.) for each guard.
- **Outcome Scenarios**: Potential outcomes based on the user's chosen actions.
- **Game Planning**: Customize game plans based on guard preferences and opponent styles.
